                    personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of
                    most of
                    the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to
                    begin
                    considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing
                    on
                    revenge less than at the start of the series.</p>

                    Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but is unaffected by it as
                    an
                    adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto's success, training him to be a great ninja. Kakashi is a
                    master of the Sharingan, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha. Kakashi's
                    original eye was restored late into part 2 of the series.</p>
