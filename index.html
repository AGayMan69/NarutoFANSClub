                    <p class="chakra_text">Chakra is essential to even the most basic jutsu. Through various methods,
                        the most common of which is hand seals, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an
                        effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire, or
                        creating illusions. </p>

                <p class="panel_description">Water Release jutsu are most easily performed using existing water
                    sources,
                    such as lakes or rivers. Users can also create water within their bodies with chakra, which they
                    expel from their mouths, though this is generally regarded as a testament of skill; Tobirama
                    Senju's
                    ability to produce his own water is noted to be proof of his position as Hokage.</p>

                <p class="panel_description">Wind Release is the rarest of the five nature transformations,[1] but
                    those
                    who can use it are able to cut through anything.[2] Asuma Sarutobi uses it by channelling wind
                    chakra into his Chakra Blades, making the blades far sharper and giving them greater reach.</p>

                <p class="panel_description">Fire Release is almost always used offensively, typically by kneading
                    chakra in the body into flames that the user breathes from the mouth.[1] Simpler applications of
                    Fire Release include creating a stream of fire, or alternatively breaking the stream into bursts
                    of
                    flames.</p>

                    clay,
                    and in fact often entails changing one to another. For most Earth Release jutsu, users place
                    their
                    hands on the ground and use their chakra to alter its form</p>

                <p class="panel_description">In order to perform most Lightning Release jutsu, users must convert
                    their
                    chakra into electricity.[1] One of the simpler ways to use this electricity is to channel it
                    into
                    ninja tools, increasing the weapon's cutting power by making it vibrate or causing a numbing
                    effect
                    to those the weapons contact.</p>

                    the generals that take care of shinobi matters. The Naruto world is similar to feudal Japan in
                    many
                    aspects; those countries maintain balance between themselves through nothing but power. Treaties
                    are
                    periodically signed, but they are generally not worth much more than the paper they are written
                    on.</p>

                    ability
                    to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine living entities, what would become the tailed

            <p class="swar__description">The world of Naruto has almost always been caught up in wars. Before creating
                the shinobi villages system, the Warring States Era lasted for decades, if not centuries, and saw one
                clan kill another to gain power. With Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha creating a place where peace was
                supposed to prosper in Konohagakure, the other Great Nations followed them, and thus, the shinobi
                villages were born. However, the birth of shinobi villages didn't stop wars. Soon after, the world got
                embroiled in the First Great Ninja War, followed by three more. Here is every great ninja war in the
                Naruto series broken down and explained.</p>
